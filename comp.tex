\section{Introduction}
I use the following scheme: 1 point is roughly AMC 10 8-14 level. 2 points is roughly AMC 10 \# 15-17 level. 3 points is AMC 10 \# 18-21 level. 4 and 5 points are AMC 10 \# 22-25 level. Points above $5$ scale similarily.

Most of these problems are from more obscure contests that will serve as good AIME and AMC practice. 
\section{Combinatorics}
\subsection{Casework}
\prob{2}{BmMT 2014}{Call a positive integer top-heavy if at least half of its digits are in the set \{7, 8, 9\}. How many
three digit top-heavy numbers exist? (No number can have a leading zero.)}

\begin{sol}
Consider $7,8,9$ to be the same and assign actual values at end, do casework on number of $7,8,9$.
\end{sol}

\prob{3}{PuMAC 2019}{Suppose Alan, Michael, Kevin, Igor, and Big Rahul are in a running race. It is given that
exactly one pair of people tie (for example, two people both get second place), so that no other
pair of people end in the same position. Each competitor has equal skill; this means that each
outcome of the race, given that exactly two people tie, is equally likely. The probability that
Big Rahul gets first place (either by himself or he ties for first) can be expressed in the form
$m/n$, where m, n are relatively prime, positive integers. Compute $m + n$.}

\begin{sol} 
First, find total number of outcomes. Then, casework on if Big Rahul wins by himself or if he ties for first
\end{sol}

\prob{3}{PuMAC 2019}{Prinstan Trollner and Dukejukem are competing at the game show WASS. Both players spin
a wheel which chooses an integer from 1 to 50 uniformly at random, and this number becomes
their score. Dukejukem then flips a weighted coin that lands heads with probability 3/5. If
he flips heads, he adds 1 to his score. A player wins the game if their score is higher than
the other player’s score. The probability Dukejukem defeats the Trollner to win WASS equals
$m/n$ where $m, n$ are coprime positive integers. Compute $m + n$.}

\begin{sol} 
Casework on if Dukejukem flips heads or tails on coin.
\end{sol}

\prob{4}{Purple Comet 2015 HS}{
Seven people of seven different ages are attending a meeting. The seven people leave the meeting one at a
time in random order. Given that the youngest person leaves the meeting sometime before the oldest
person leaves the meeting, the probability that the third, fourth, and ﬁfth people to leave the meeting do so in order of their ages (youngest to oldest) is $\frac{m}{n}$ , where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.}

\begin{sol}
 Casework on if youngest or oldest in third, fourth, fifth block.
\end{sol}

\prob{5}{HMMT November 2014}{Consider the set of 5-tuples of positive integers at most $5$. We say the tuple $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)$ is perfect if for any distinct indices $i, j, k$, the three numbers $a_i
, a_j , a_k$ do not form an arithmetic progression (in any order). Find the number of perfect 5-tuples.}

\prob{5}{HMMT November 2013}{Find the number of positive integer divisors of $12!$ that leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$.}

\begin{sol} 
Casework on parity of exponent of $2,5,11$. Note that there can't be any $3$ and $7$ can be included or excluded without consequence.
\end{sol}

\subsubsection{PIE}
\prob{1}{}{How many integers from $1$ to $100$ (inclusive) are multiples of $2$ or $3?$}

\begin{sol}
There are $50$ multiples of $2$ and $33$ multiples of $3$. If and only if a number is both a multiple of $2$ and $3$, then it is a multiple of $6$. There are $16$ multiples of $6$. Our ansewr is $50+33-16=\boxed{67}$.
\end{sol}

\prob{1}{AMC 10B 2017/13}{There are $20$ students participating in an after-school program offering classes in yoga, bridge, and painting. Each student must take at least one of these three classes, but may take two or all three. There are $10$ students taking yoga, $13$ taking bridge, and $9$ taking painting. There are $9$ students taking at least two classes. How many students are taking all three classes?}

\prob{7}{SLKK AIME 2020}{
Andy the Banana Thief is trying to hide from Sheriff Buffkin in a row of
6 distinct houses labeled 1 through 6. Andy and Sheriff Buffkin each pick a permutation
of the 6 houses, chosen uniformly at random. On the $n^{\text{th}}$ day, with $1 \leq n \leq 6$, Andy
and Sheriff Buffkin visit the $n^{\text{th}}$ house in their respective permutations, and Andy is
caught by the Sheriff on the first day they visit the same house. For example, if Andy’s
permutation is $1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2$ and Sheriff Buffkin’s permutation is $3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2$, Andy is
caught on day $4$. Given that Sheriff Buffkin catches Andy within 6 days and the expected
number of days it takes to catch Andy can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$
for relatively prime positive
integers $a$ and $b$, find the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by $1000$.}

\begin{sol} 
Notice that we can fix Sheriff Buffkin's permutation to just be $1,2,3,4,5,6$ because for each of Buffkin's permutation, the probability of being caught on the $n$th day clearly doesn't change. The number of Andy's permutations such that he does get caught is $6!-D_{6}=455$. Then, we do casework on day caught and then use complementary PIE. If he is caught on the $n$th day, the $n$th number inf Andy's permutation is clearly $n$. Then, we do PIE on the number of permutations  such that at least one of the previous numbers are the same. This turns out to be $\binom{n-1}{1}\cdot 4! - \binom{n-1}{2}\cdot 3! + \binom{n-1}{3}\cdot 2! \cdots$. Then, the probability that he is caught on the $n$th day is $\frac{5!-\binom{n-1}{1}\cdot 4! + \binom{n-1}{2}\cdot 3! - \binom{n-1}{3}\cdot 2! \cdots}{6!}$.


Doing the computation for all days, we get $\frac{1331}{455}\implies \boxed{786}$.
\end{sol}

\subsection{Perspectives}
\prob{1}{AIME I 2002/1}{Many states use a sequence of three letters followed by a sequence of three digits as their standard license-plate pattern. Given that each three-letter three-digit arrangement is equally likely, the probability that such a license plate will contain at least one palindrome (a three-letter arrangement or a three-digit arrangement that reads the same left-to-right as it does right-to-left) is $\dfrac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$}

\begin{sol}
Calculate the complementary probability. The probability that the three numbers aren't a palindrome is $1\cdot 1\cdot \frac{9}{10}=\frac{9}{10}$. The probability the three lettters aren't a palindrome is $1\cdot 1\cdot \frac{25}{26}=\frac{25}{26}$. Multiplying together, the probability both aren't a palindrome is $\frac{9\cdot 25}{10\cdot 26}=\frac{9\cdot 5}{2\cdot 26}=\frac{45}{52}$. So, our wanted probability is $1-\frac{45}{52}=\frac{7}{52}\implies \boxed{59}$.
\end{sol}

\prob{1}{PuMAC 2019}{How many ways can you arrange 3 Alice’s, 1 Bob, 3 Chad’s, and 1 David in a line if the Alice’s
are all indistinguishable, the Chad’s are all indistinguishable, and Bob and David want to be
adjacent to each other? (In other words, how many ways can you arrange 3 A’s, 1 B, 3 C’s,
and 1 D in a row where the B and D are adjacent?)}

\begin{sol} 
Consider BD as one block of E and then multiply by $2!=2$ at the end to permute the B and D's. We want to arrange 3 A's, 1 E, and 3 C's. There are $\frac{7!}{3!3!}=\frac{5040}{6\cdot 6}=140$ such permutations. So, the total number of ways is $\boxed{280}$
\end{sol}

\prob{2}{MA$\theta$ 2016}{The product of any two of the elements of the set $\{30, 54, N\}$ is divisible by the third. Find
the number of possible values of N.}

\begin{sol}
 Consider the primes $2,3,5$ separately and get independent inequalities.
\end{sol}

\prob{2}{2017 AMC 10B/17}{Call a positive integer $monotonous$ if it is a one-digit number or its digits, when read from left to right, form either a strictly increasing or a strictly decreasing sequence. For example, $3$, $23578$, and $987620$ are monotonous, but $88$, $7434$, and $23557$ are not. How many monotonous positive integers are there?}


\prob{2}{AIME II 2002/9}{Let $\mathcal{S}$ be the set $\lbrace1,2,3,\ldots,10\rbrace$ Let $n$ be the number of sets of two non-empty disjoint subsets of $\mathcal{S}$. (Disjoint sets are defined as sets that have no common elements.) Find the remainder obtained when $n$ is divided by $1000$.}

\begin{sol} 
We count the number of ordered pairs for now and divide by two at the end. For each element, we have $3$ choices: in either of the sets or in neither. But, we also need to subtract off when at least one of the subsets is empty. If at least one is empty, there's $2$ choices for each element. If both are empty, there is $1$ choice for each element. We also have to divide by two in the end to make it unordered (and note that it's impossible for the two sets to be the same). 

$$\frac{3^{10}-2\cdot 2^{10}+1}{2} = \frac{59049-2048+1}{2}=\frac{57002}{2}=28\boxed{501}$$
\end{sol} 

\prob{2}{AMC 10B 2018/22}{Real numbers $x$ and $y$ are chosen independently and uniformly at random from the interval $[0,1]$. What is the probability that $x,y,$ and $1$ are the side lengths of an obtuse triangle?}

\begin{sol} 
Note that $1>x,y$ so $1$ is opposite the obtuse angle. This gives the inequalty $1>x^2+y^2$. Also, by the Triangle Inequalty, $1 < x+y$. Graphing this, we want the area under the quarter unit circle centered at $(0,0)$ but above the line from $(0,1)$ to $(1,0)$. This has area $\boxed{\frac{\pi-2}{4}}$
\end{sol}

\prob{2}{AMC 10B 2020/23}{Square $ABCD$ in the coordinate plane has vertices at the points $A(1,1), B(-1,1), C(-1,-1),$ and $D(1,-1).$ Consider the following four transformations:
    
\begin{itemize}
    \Item $L,$ a rotation of $90^{\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin;

    \Item $R,$ a rotation of $90^{\circ}$ clockwise around the origin;
    
    \Item $H,$ a reflection across the $x$-axis; and

    \Item $V,$ a reflection across the $y$-axis.
\end{itemize}

Each of these transformations maps the squares onto itself, but the positions of the labeled vertices will change. For example, applying $R$ and then $V$ would send the vertex $A$ at $(1,1)$ to $(-1,-1)$ and would send the vertex $B$ at $(-1,1)$ to itself. How many sequences of $20$ transformations chosen from $\{L, R, H, V\}$ will send all of the labeled vertices back to their original positions? (For example, $R, R, V, H$ is one sequence of $4$ transformations that will send the vertices back to their original positions.)}

\begin{sol} 
Notice that after any sequence of $19$ moves, we have a unique move that takes the square back to its original square. So, the total number of sequences is $4^{19}=\boxed{2^{38}}$.
\end{sol}

\prob{2}{CNCM Online Round 1}{Pooki Sooki has 8 hoodies, and he may wear any of them throughout a 7 day week. He changes hishoodie exactly $2$ times during the week, and will only do so at one of the 6 midnights. Once he changes out of a
hoodie, he never wears it for the rest of the week. The number of ways he can wear his hoodies throughout the week
can be expressed as $\frac{8!}{2^k}$ . Find $k$.}

\begin{sol} 
There is $8\cdot 7\cdot 6$ ways to choose the hoodies Pooki wears and there are $\binom{6}{2}=15=3\cdot 5$ ways to choose the midnights he changes. The number of ways is then $8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 3 = \frac{8!}{4\cdot 2}=\frac{8!}{2^{3}}$. Our answer is $\boxed{3}$.
\end{sol}

\prob{3}{BmMT 2014}{If you roll three regular six-sided dice, what is the probability that the three numbers showing
will form an arithmetic sequence? (The order of the dice does matter, but we count both (1,
3, 2) and (1, 2, 3) as arithmetic sequences.)}

\begin{sol} 
We count the number of ordered triplets $(a,b,c)$ such that two of the numbers average to the third number. WLOG $a\leq b\leq c$. Note that if $a,b,c$ are distinct, then this corresponds to $6$ ordered triplets. Otherwise, $a=b=c$ and this clearly corresponds to only $1$ ordered triplet.

For the first case, notice that this is identical to choosing two numbers $a,c$ (unordered) and seeing if their average is an integer. This happens if $a,c$ are the same parity. Then, this gives $\binom{3}{2} + \binom{3}{2}=6$ $(a,b,c)$ such that $a\leq b\leq c$. We multiply by $6$ to get the full number of ordered triplets which is $36$.

For the second case, this clearly has $6$ ordered $(a,b,c)$.

Then, our probability is $\frac{42}{216}=\boxed{\frac{7}{36}}$.
\end{sol}

\prob{4}{PuMAC 2019}{Keith has 10 coins labeled 1 through 10, where the ith coin has weight $2^i$. The coins are all
fair, so the probability of flipping heads on any of the coins is $\frac{1}{2}$. After flipping all of the
coins, Keith takes all of the coins which land heads and measures their total weight, $W$. If the
probability that $137 \leq W \leq 1061$ is $m/n$ for coprime positive integers $m, n$, determine $m + n$}

\begin{sol} 
This bijects to even binary numbers between $0$ and $2046$. There $\frac{1060-138}{2}+1=462$ even numbers in the range $[137,1061]$. Then, $\frac{462}{1024}=\frac{231}{512}\implies \boxed{743}$.

\prob{4}{PHS HMMT TST 2016}{Compute the number of ordered triples of sets $(A_{1},A_{2},A_{3})$ that satisfy the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup A_{3} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
\item $A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3} = \emptyset$
\end{enumerate}}

\begin{sol}
Consider each element separately and see where it can go in the Venn Diagram. It can go in $8-2=6$ sections as it can't be in all three or not in any. So, $\boxed{6^6}$.

\prob{5} {HMMT Feburary 2014}{We have a calculator with two buttons that displays an integer x. Pressing the first button replaces
$x$ by $\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$ , and pressing the second button replaces $x$ by $4x + 1$. Initially, the calculator displays 0.

presses? (It is permitted for the number displayed to exceed 2014 during the sequence. Here, byc

\begin{sol}
Any number with $1$ digits separated by one or more $0$'s  is valid. Notice that for $2015$ through $2047$, the first two digits are $11$ so they are not valid. Casework on number of digits now.

\subsubsection{Stars and Bars}

\prob{1}{AMC 8 2019/25}{Alice has $24$ apples. In how many ways can she share them with Becky and Chris so that each person (include Alice) has at least $2$ apples?}

\begin{sol}
We have $a+b+c=24$ and $a\ge 2$ while $b,c\ge 0$. Let $a'=a-2$. Then, $a'\ge 0$. We have $a'+b+c=22$. By Stars and Bars, there are $\binom{24}{2}=23\cdot 12=\boxed{276}$ ways to distribute.

\prob{1}{AMC 10A 2003/21}{Pat is to select six cookies from a tray containing only chocolate chip, oatmeal, and peanut butter cookies. There are at least six of each of these three kinds of cookies on the tray. How many different assortments of six cookies can be selected?}

\begin{sol} 
Let $a,b,c$ be the number of choclate chip, oatmetal, and peanut butter cookies repsecitvely. Then, $a+b+c=6$ has $\binom{8}{2}=\boxed{28}$ distributions.

\prob{1}{AMC 10A 2018/11}{When 7 fair standard 6-sided dice are thrown, the probability that the sum of the numbers on the top faces is 10 can be written as \[\frac{n}{6^7},\]where $n$ is a positive integer. What is $n$?}

\begin{sol} 
Let the $i$th dice roll $x_{i}$. Notice that $x_{i}\ge 1$. Let $x_{i}'=x_{1}-1$. Then, $x_{1}+x_{2}\cdots + x_{7}=10\implies x_{1}+x_{2}\cdots + x_{7}=3$ has $\binom{9}{6}=\boxed{84}$ distributions. Note that it is impossible for any of the $x_{i}$'s to exceed $6$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item No two consecutive integers belong to $S$.
    
    \item If $S$ contains $k$ elements, then $S$ contains no number less than $k$.
\end{enumerate}}

\begin{sol} 
We can do casework on the number of elements $k$. Then, we can only have numbers in the range $\{k,k+1\cdots 15\}$. Now, let the elements in the subset be $a_{1},a_{2}\cdots a_{k}$. Let $d_{1}=a_{1}-k$, $d_{2}=a_{2}-a_{1}$, $d_{3}=a_{3}-a_{2}$ and so on until $d_{k}=a_{k}-a_{k-1}$ and $d_{k+1}=15-a_{k}$. We have that $d_{1}+d_{2}\cdots + d_{k}+d_{k+1}=15-k$. 

Notice that $d_{2},d_{3}\cdots d_{k}\ge 2$ to satisfy that no two consecutive integers are in $S$. So, let $d_{k}'=d_{k}-2$ for $k=2,3\cdots k$. So, $d_{1}+d_{2}'+d_{3}'\cdots +d_{k}'+d_{k+1}=15-k-2(k-1)=17-3k$. By Stars and Bars, there are $\binom{17-2k}{k}$ ordered $(k+1)$-tuplets $(d_{1},d_{2}\cdots d_{k+1})$. Notice that $(d_{1},d_{2}\cdots d_{k+1})$ determines $a_{1},a_{2}\cdots a_{k}$.

You get $k\cdot (6k+1)\cdot (12k+1)=n^2$. All of these are pairwise coprime so each are squares. Trying out the first couple of squares for $k$, we get $k=4$ is a solution. $k=4$ gives $2^2\cdot 5^2\cdot 7^2=n^2\implies n = 70$.

We have $n=100q+r\implies n\pmod{11}=q+r$. So, $q+r=0\pmod{11}\iff n=0\pmod{11}$. The smallest 5-digit multiple of $11$ is $10010$ and the largest is $99990$. So, there are $\frac{99990-10010}{11}+1=9090-910+1=\boxed{8181}$.

\begin{sol}
First, note that $N\leq 4$. Any $4$-element subset has all of at least one of the following: $\{1,6\},\{2,5\},\{3,4\},\{7\}$ by the Pigeonhole Principle.

\begin{sol}
Also, $19!=0\pmod{125}$ by Legendre's so $H=0$. Note that $19!=0\pmod{9}$ so $T+M+H+33=0\pmod{9}\implies T+M+H=3\pmod{9}\implies T+M=3\pmod{9}\implies T+M=3,12$.  We also have $19!=0\pmod{11}\implies H-2+3-8+M-0+4-0+0-1+5-T+6-1+2-1=0\pmod{11}\implies H+M-T+7=0\pmod{11}\implies H+M-T=4\pmod{11}\implies M-T=4\pmod{11}\implies M-T=4$ since $0\leq M,T\leq 9$.

\begin{sol}
Notice that $n^3=n\pmod{2}$ and that $n^3=n\pmod{3}$ by Euler's Totient Theorem. So, $n^3=n\pmod{6}$ by CRT. Then, $a_1^3+a_2^3\cdots + a_{2018}^3=a_{1}+a_{2}\cdots +a_{2018}\pmod{6}=2018^{2018}\pmod{6}$. Now, $2018^{2018}\pmod{2}=0$ and $2018^{2018}\pmod{3}=(-1)^{2018}\pmod{3}=1$.

We have two cases: $ad$ is even and $bc$ is odd or $ad$ is odd and $bc$ is even. If $ad$ is even, then we can do complementary counting and get $4^{2}-2^{2}=12$ ways for $(a,d)$.

If either of $n, n+2$ are composite, WLOG $n=0\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p<n$, then $(n-1)!=0\pmod{p}\implies n+4=0\pmod{p}\implies 4 =0\pmod{p}$ contradiction. Similar for $n+2$. Then, we have that $n,n+2$ must be both primes. We show that this works. We have $4(n-1)!+n+4\pmod{n}=-4+4=0\pmod{n}$ by Wilsons'.

Adding the first two and dividng by $4$ gives $x^2+y^2+z^2=30$. Then, $(x+y+z)^2=x^2+y^2+z^2+2(xy+xz+yz)=16\implies x+y+z=\pm 4$. Also, $(x+y)^2+(x+z)^2+(y+z)^2=2(x^2+y^2+z^2)+2(xy+xz+yz)=46$. 

Let $x+y=a, x+z=b, y+z=c$. We get $a+b+c=\pm 8$ and $a^2+b^2+c^2=46$. The only decomposition of $46$ into squares is $36,9,1$. So, $(6,3,-1)$ and $(-6,-3,1)$ are our only solutions for $(a,b,c)$ (including permutations since it is symmetric). Notice that $(a,b,c)$ being a permutation of $(6,3,-1)$ means $(x,y,z)$ is a permutation of $(5,1,-2)$. Similarily, $(a,b,c)$ being a permutation of $(-6,-3,1)$ means $(x,y,z)$ is a permutation of $(-5,-1,2)$.

We look at which permutations of $(5,1,-2)$ work. We can biject any valid permutation of $(5,1,-2)$ to get a corresponding solution $(-x,-y,-z)$ for permutations of $(-5,-1,2)$. It's clear only $x$ can be $5$ otherwise $2y^2,3z^2>36$. Then, $2y^2+z^2=9\implies y=2,z=-1$. So the only valid solution is $(5,2,-1)$ and the corresponding solution is $(-5,-2,1)$.

To find $x+\frac{1}{x}$, we set it to a value $n$. $n^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} + 2 \implies n^2 = 5$, and we know $x+\frac{1}{x}$ is positive, so $x+\frac{1}{x} = \sqrt{5}$. So, our final answer is $\boxed{21\sqrt{5}}$.

\begin{sol}
We can do some pattern finding when $2$ appears $n$ times. When $n=1$, this is $\frac{1}{2}$. When $n=2$, this is $\frac{2}{3}$. We conjecture that when $2$ appears $n$ times, the expresion is $\frac{n}{n+1}$. We can prove this by induction. With $2$ appearing $n+1$ times, we have $\frac{1}{2-\frac{1}{2-\frac{1}{2\cdots}}} = \frac{1}{2-\frac{n}{n+1}}=\frac{n+1}{n+2}$.

Notice that $\frac{a^2}{a+b}=\frac{a^2}{a+c}+20\implies \frac{a^2(a+c)-a^2(a+b)}{(a+b)(a+c)}=20\implies \frac{a^2(c-b)}{(a+b)(a+c)}=20$. Similarily, $\frac{b^2(a-c)}{(b+c)(b+a)}=14$ and $\frac{c^2(b-a)}{(c+a)(c+b)}=x$. Summing, we get $\frac{a^{2}(c^2-b^2)+b^{2}(a^2-c^2)+c^2(b^2-a^2)}{(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}=0=34+x\implies x = \boxed{-34}$.

\begin{sol}
Let $2015=y$. Then, we have $\sqrt{x+y}=x^2-y\implies x+y=x^4-2x^2y+y^2\implies y^2+(-2x^2-1)y+x^4-x=0$. Then, $y=\frac{2x^2+1 \pm (2x+1)}{2}$. Now, we have $2015=x^2+x+1$ or $2015=x^2-x$. These give $x=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{8057}}{2}$ and $x=\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{8061}}{2}$. Now, note that we have $x+y\ge 0 \implies x \ge -2015$ and $x^2-y\ge 0\implies |x|\ge \sqrt{2015}$. \\
\\
We can see that $\frac{-1 + \sqrt{8057}}{2}>\sqrt{2015}$ and that $\frac{-1-\sqrt{8057}}{2} < -\sqrt{2015}$. Also, $\frac{1-\sqrt{8061}}{2} > - \sqrt{2015}$ and $\frac{1+\sqrt{8061}}{2} > \sqrt{2015}$. So, we have that our two solutions are $\frac{-1-\sqrt{8057}}{2}$ and $\frac{1+\sqrt{8061}}{2}$. \\
\\
Then, $\frac{1}{S}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{8061}-\sqrt{8057}}=\frac{\sqrt{8061}+\sqrt{8057}}{2}$. So, $89 < \frac{1}{S} < 90$ so our answer is $\boxed{89}$

Using the formula for an infinite geometric series, we get $\frac{p}{1-q}=2\implies p=2-2q$ and $\frac{q}{1-p}=3\implies q=3-3p\implies p=\frac{3-q}{3}$. So, $\frac{3-q}{3}=2-2q\implies 3-q=6-6q\implies 5q=3\implies q =\frac{3}{5}\implies p =\frac{4}{5}$. Then $100pq=100\cdot \frac{12}{25}=\boxed{48}$.

These are problems that don't really fall into any other category at all.
\subsection{Games}

\prob{2}{BmMT 2016}{
Suppose you have a $20 \times 16$ bar of chocolate squares. You want to break the bar into smaller
chunks, so that after some sequence of breaks, no piece has an area of more than 5. What is the
minimum possible number of times that you must break the bar?}

\begin{sol} 
By the Pigeon Hole Principle, at the end, there should be at least $\frac{320}{5}=64$ pieces. It takes at least $63$ moves to break it into $64$ pieces as each move creates one more piece. We can also construct a sequence of moves by noticing that this is equalty case of the Pigeon Hole Principle so each piece must have exactly $5$ squares. Break it into $16$ of $20\times 1$ pieces. This uses $15$ moves. Then, break each of those pieces into $4$ of $5\times 1$ pieces. This uses $3\cdot 16=48$ moves. So, our answer is $\boxed{63}$
\end{sol}

\prob{3}{BMT 2015}{Two players play a game with a pile with N coins is on a table. On a player’s turn, if there
are n coins, the player can take at most $\frac{n}{2} + 1$ coins, and must take at least one coin. The
player who grabs the last coin wins. For how many values of N between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
does the first player have a winning strategy?}

\subsection{Logic}
\prob{2}{BmMT 2014}{Alice, Bob, Carl, and Dave are either lying or telling the truth. If the four of them make the
following statements, who has the coin?
\begin{center}
Alice: I have the coin.

Bob: Carl has the coin.

Carl: Exactly one of us is telling the truth.

Dave: The person who has the coin is male.
\end{center}}

\begin{sol}
Analyzing, Carl must be lying since if he was telling the truth, everyone else are lying which means Alice can't have the coin but the person who has the coin isn't male which is a contradiction. Also note that all of them can't be lying by similar reasoning. So, either two, three, or four are telling the truth. Four telling the truth is impossible as Carl's statement is false. Three telling the truth means everyone but Carl is telling the truth which is impossible as Alice and Dave's statements conflict. So, two must be telling the truth. Dave's and Alice's statements are true if and only if the other is false. If Dave is false and Alice is true, then Bob must also be false which is a contradiction to the fact two are telling the truth. If Dave is true and Alice is false, then Bob must be telling the truth and \boxed{Carl} has the coin. This is the only possible case.
\end{sol}

\prob{2}{Berkeley Math Circle 2013}{
Ten people sit side by side at a long table, all facing the same direction. Each of them is either a knight (and always
tells the truth) or a knave (and always lies). Each of the people announces: “There are more knaves on my left than
knights on my right.” How many knaves are in the line?
}

\begin{sol}
$5$ knaves on the left, $5$ knights on the right gives a valid solution. So, $\boxed{5}$.
