\section{Introduction}
I use the following scheme: 1 point is roughly AMC 10 8-14 level. 2 points is roughly AMC 10 \# 15-17 level. 3 points is AMC 10 \# 18-21 level. 4 and 5 points are AMC 10 \# 22-25 level.

Most of these problems are from more obscure contests that will serve as good AIME and AMC practice. 
\section{Combinatorics}
\subsection{Casework}
 \prob{4}{Purple Comet 2015 HS}{
Seven people of seven different ages are attending a meeting. The seven people leave the meeting one at a
time in random order. Given that the youngest person leaves the meeting sometime before the oldest
person leaves the meeting, the probability that the third, fourth, and ﬁfth people to leave the meeting do so in order of their ages (youngest to oldest) is $\frac{m}{n}$ , where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.}

\prob{5}{HMMT November 2014}{Consider the set of 5-tuples of positive integers at most $5$. We say the tuple $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)$ is perfect if for any distinct indices $i, j, k$, the three numbers $a_i
, a_j , a_k$ do not form an arithmetic progression (in any order). Find the number of perfect 5-tuples.}

\prob{5}{HMMT November 2013}{Find the number of positive integer divisors of $12!$ that leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$.}
\subsection{Perspectives}
\prob{2}{MA$\theta$ 2016}{The product of any two of the elements of the set $\{30, 54, N\}$ is divisible by the third. Find
the number of possible values of N.}

\sol Consider the primes $2,3,5$ separately and get independent inequalities.

\prob{4}{PHS HMMT TST 2016}{Compute the number of ordered triples of sets $(A_{1},A_{2},A_{3})$ that satisfy the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup A_{3} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
\item $A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3} = \emptyset$
\end{enumerate}

\prob{6} {HMMT Feburary 2014}{We have a calculator with two buttons that displays an integer x. Pressing the first button replaces
$x$ by $\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$ , and pressing the second button replaces $x$ by $4x + 1$. Initially, the calculator displays 0.
How many integers less than or equal to 2014 can be achieved through a sequence of arbitrary button
presses? (It is permitted for the number displayed to exceed 2014 during the sequence. Here, byc
denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number y.)}

\sol Any number with $1$ digits separated by one or more $0$'s  is valid. Notice that for $2015$ through $2047$, the first two digits are $11$ so they are not valid. Casework on number of digits now.

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\prob{1}{Mandelbrot Nationals Sample Test}{Michael Jordan's probability of hitting any basketball shot is three times greater than mine, which never exceeds a third.

\sol What's the max of $p(1-3p)$? 

\prob{3}{PHS ARML TST 2017}{Consider a group of eleven high school students. To create a middle school math contest, they must

\subsection{Divisors}
\prob{1}{MA$\theta$ 2018}{How many distinct prime numbers are in the first 50 rows of Pascal’s Triangle?}

\sol If $k\neq 1,n-1$ for $\binom{n}{k}$, then $\binom{n}{k}$ is composite by its explicit formula. So, $\binom{n}{1}=n$, how many of those are prime for $1\leq n\leq 50$? 

\prob{2}{AHSME 1984}{ How many triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers satisify the simultaneous equations:
$$ab+bc=44$$
$$ac+bc=23$$}

\prob{2}{PHS ARML TST 2017}{Compute the greatest prime factor of 
$$3^8+2\cdot 2^4\cdot 4^4+2^{16}$$}

\sol Let $3^4=x$ and $4^4=y$. Then, this is just $x^2+2xy+y^2=(x+y)^2$.

\prob{2}{HMMT November 2014}{Compute the greatest common divisor of $4^8 - 1$ and $8^{12} - 1$}

\prob{3}{MA$\theta$ 2018}{The number $1 \cdot 1! + 2 \cdot 2! + 3 \cdot 3! +\cdots + 100 \cdot 100!$ ends with a string of 9s. How many
consecutive 9s are at the end of the number?}

\sol $n\cdot n! = (n+1)!-n!$, then telescope to get $101!-1!$. How many $0$'s does $101!$ have?

\subsection{Modulo}

\prob{1}{MA$\theta$ 2018}{The number $4^{14}-1$ is divisible by $29$ but $2^{14}-1$ is not. What is the remainder when $2^{14}-1$ is divided by $29$?}

\sol $4^{14}-1=(2^{14}-1)(2^{14}+1)=0\pmod{29}$. Since $2^{14}-1\neq 0 \pmod{29}$, $2^{14}+1=0\pmod{29}\implies 2^{14}-1=27\pmod{29}$

\prob{3}{CNCM PoTD}{Find the number of positive integer $x$ less than $100$ such that 
$$3^x+5^x+7^x+11^x+13^x+17^x+19^x$$ is prime.}

\sol Considering $\pmod{3}$, we get $3(1)^x+3(-1)^x=0\pmod{3}$ which is impossible as the expression is clearly $>3$. So, $\boxed{0}$.

\prob{5}{PHS HMMT TST 2020}{Find the largest integer $0 < n < 100$ such that $n^2 + 2n$ divides $4(n-1)! + n + 4$.}

\sol For $n$ is even, $n^2+2n=(n)(n+2)=4(\frac{n}{2})(\frac{n+2}{2})$. $4(n-1)!=0\pmod{4(\frac{n}{2})(\frac{n+2}}{2})$, then we get $n+4=0\pmod{n^2+2n}$ which is impossible. For $n$ is odd, $n^2+2n=(n)(n+2)$ and $\gcd(n,n+2)=1$. If either of $n, n+2$ are composite, WLOG $n=0\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p<n$, then $(n-1)!=0\pmod{p}\implies n+4=0\pmod{p}\implies 4 =0\pmod{p}$ contradiction. Similar for $n+2$. Then, we have that $n,n+2$ must be both primes. We show that this works. We have $4(n-1)!+n+4\pmod{n}=-4+4=0\pmod{n}$ by Wilsons'. Also, $4(n-1)!+n+4\pmod{n+2}=2+4\frac{-1}{(n+1)(n)}\pmod{n+2}=2+4\frac{-1}{2}\pmod{n+2}=2-2=0\pmod{n+2}$. Since $\gcd(n,n+2)=1$, we're done.

The largest twin primes in the range are $\boxed{71},73$.

\prob{7}{HMMT November 2014}{Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are integers with $1 \leq m \leq 49$ and $n \ge 0$ such that $m$ divides $n^{n+1} + 1$. What is the number of possible values of $m$?}

\subsection{Bases}
\prob{4}{HMMT November 2014}{Mark and William are playing a game with a stored value. On his turn, a player may either multiply
the stored value by 2 and add 1 or he may multiply the stored value by 4 and add 3. The first player
to make the stored value exceed 2100 wins. The stored value starts at 1 and Mark goes first. Assuming
both players play optimally, what is the maximum number of times that William can make a move?
(By optimal play, we mean that on any turn the player selects the move which leads to the best possible
outcome given that the opponent is also playing optimally. If both moves lead to the same outcome,
the player selects one of them arbitrarily.)
}

\prob{4}{HMMT November 2013}{ How many of the first 1000 positive integers can be written as the sum of finitely many distinct
numbers from the sequence $3^{0},3^{1},3^{2}\cdots$?}

\prob{6}{HMMT November 2014}{For any positive integers $a$ and $b$, define $a \oplus b$ to be the result when adding a to b in binary (base 2), neglecting any carry-overs. For example, $20 \oplus 14 = 101002 \oplus 11102 = 110102 = 26$. (The operation $\oplus$ is called the exclusive or.) Compute the sum
$$\sum_{k=0}^{2^{2014}-1} (k\oplus \lfloor \frac{k}{2} \rfloor)$$}

\subsection{Manipulation}

\prob{2}{PHS HMMT TST 2020}{What is the value of $\frac{\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{3^2} \cdots}{\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{5^2}\cdots}$? Remember that $\frac{1}{1^2}+\frac{1}{2^2}\cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}$}

}

\prob{3}{MA$\theta$ 2018}{The solutions to $3\sqrt{2x^2-5x-3}+2x^2-5x=7$ can be written in the form $x=\frac{a \pm \sqrt{b}}{c}$ where $a,b,c$ are positive integers and $x$ is in simplest form. Find $a+b+c$.}

\prob{4}{Mandelbrot Nationals 2008}{
Find the positive real number $x$ for which $5\sqrt{1-x}+5\sqrt{1+x}=7\sqrt{2}$.}

Compute $x$.}

\prob{5}{Math Prizes For Girls 2015}{
Let $S$ be the sum of all distinct real solutions of the equation 
$$\sqrt{x + 2015} = x^2 - 2015.$$
Compute $\lfloor 1/S \rfloor$.  Recall that if $r$ is a real number, then $\lfloor r \rfloor$ (the floor of $r$) is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $r$}

\sol Let $2015=y$. Then, we have $\sqrt{x+y}=x^2-y\implies x+y=x^4-2x^2y+y^2\implies y^2+(-2x^2-1)y+x^4-x=0$. Then, $y=\frac{2x^2+1 \pm (2x+1)}{2}$. Now, we have $2015=x^2+x+1$ or $2015=x^2-x$. These give $x=\frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{8057}}{2}$ and $x=\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{8061}}{2}$. Now, note that we have $x+y\ge 0 \implies x \ge -2015$ and $x^2-y\ge 0\implies |x|\ge \sqrt{2015}$. \\
\\
We can see that $\frac{-1 + \sqrt{8057}}{2}>\sqrt{2015}$ and that $\frac{-1-\sqrt{8057}}{2} < -\sqrt{2015}$. Also, $\frac{1-\sqrt{8061}}{2} > - \sqrt{2015}$ and $\frac{1+\sqrt{8061}}{2} > \sqrt{2015}$. So, we have that our two solutions are $\frac{-1-\sqrt{8057}}{2}$ and $\frac{1+\sqrt{8061}}{2}$. \\
\\
Then, $\frac{1}{S}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{8061}-\sqrt{8057}}=\frac{\sqrt{8061}+\sqrt{8057}}{2}$. So, $89 < \frac{1}{S} < 90$ so our answer is $\boxed{89}$

\sol Let $\angle BAA_{1}=\angle A_{1}AA_{2}=\angle A_{2}AC = \alpha$. We have that $\triangle ABA_{2}$ is an isosceles triangle as $\angle ABA_{1}=\angle AA_{2}A_{1}=90-\alpha$. Then, as $AA_{1}$ is an altitude, $BA_{1}=A_{1}A_{2}$. Let $BA_{1}=A_{1}A_{2}=x$, then $A_{2}C=BA_{2}=2x$. Consider triangles $BAA_{1}$ and $\triangle A_{1}AC$. We have that $\tan \alpha = \frac{x}{AA_{1}}$ and $\tan 2\alpha = \frac{3x}{AA_{1}}$. So, $\frac{\tan 2\alpha}{\tan \alpha}= 3 \implies \tan \alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\implies \alpha = 30$.
