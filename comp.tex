\section{Introduction}
I use the following scheme: 1 point is roughly AMC 10 8-14 level. 2 points is roughly AMC 10 \# 15-17 level. 3 points is AMC 10 \# 18-21 level. 4 and 5 points are AMC 10 \# 22-25 level. Points above $5$ scale similarily.

Most of these problems are from more obscure contests that will serve as good AIME and AMC practice. 
\section{Combinatorics}
\subsection{Casework}
\prob{2}{BmMT 2014}{Call a positive integer top-heavy if at least half of its digits are in the set {7, 8, 9}. How many
three digit top-heavy numbers exist? (No number can have a leading zero.)}

\sol Consider $7,8,9$ to be the same and assign actual values at end, do casework on number of $7,8,9$.

\prob{3}{PuMAC 2019}{Suppose Alan, Michael, Kevin, Igor, and Big Rahul are in a running race. It is given that
exactly one pair of people tie (for example, two people both get second place), so that no other
pair of people end in the same position. Each competitor has equal skill; this means that each
outcome of the race, given that exactly two people tie, is equally likely. The probability that
Big Rahul gets first place (either by himself or he ties for first) can be expressed in the form
$m/n$, where m, n are relatively prime, positive integers. Compute $m + n$.}

\sol First, find total number of outcomes. Then, casework on if Big Rahul wins by himself or if he ties for first

\prob{3}{PuMAC 2019}{Prinstan Trollner and Dukejukem are competing at the game show WASS. Both players spin
a wheel which chooses an integer from 1 to 50 uniformly at random, and this number becomes
their score. Dukejukem then flips a weighted coin that lands heads with probability 3/5. If
he flips heads, he adds 1 to his score. A player wins the game if their score is higher than
the other player’s score. The probability Dukejukem defeats the Trollner to win WASS equals
$m/n$ where $m, n$ are coprime positive integers. Compute $m + n$.}

\sol Casework on if Dukejukem flips heads or tails on coin.

\prob{4}{Purple Comet 2015 HS}{
Seven people of seven different ages are attending a meeting. The seven people leave the meeting one at a
time in random order. Given that the youngest person leaves the meeting sometime before the oldest
person leaves the meeting, the probability that the third, fourth, and ﬁfth people to leave the meeting do so in order of their ages (youngest to oldest) is $\frac{m}{n}$ , where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m + n$.}

\sol Casework on if youngest or oldest in third, fourth, fifth block.

\prob{5}{HMMT November 2014}{Consider the set of 5-tuples of positive integers at most $5$. We say the tuple $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)$ is perfect if for any distinct indices $i, j, k$, the three numbers $a_i
, a_j , a_k$ do not form an arithmetic progression (in any order). Find the number of perfect 5-tuples.}

\prob{5}{HMMT November 2013}{Find the number of positive integer divisors of $12!$ that leave a remainder of $1$ when divided by $3$.}

\sol Casework on parity of exponent of $2,5,11$. Note that there can't be any $3$ and $7$ can be included or excluded without consequence.

\prob{7}{SLKK AIME 2020}{
Andy the Banana Thief is trying to hide from Sheriff Buffkin in a row of
6 distinct houses labeled 1 through 6. Andy and Sheriff Buffkin each pick a permutation
of the 6 houses, chosen uniformly at random. On the $n^{\text{th}}$ day, with $1 \leq n \leq 6$, Andy
and Sheriff Buffkin visit the $n^{\text{th}}$ house in their respective permutations, and Andy is
caught by the Sheriff on the first day they visit the same house. For example, if Andy’s
permutation is $1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 2$ and Sheriff Buffkin’s permutation is $3, 4, 1, 5, 6, 2$, Andy is
caught on day $4$. Given that Sheriff Buffkin catches Andy within 6 days and the expected
number of days it takes to catch Andy can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$
for relatively prime positive
integers $a$ and $b$, find the remainder when $a + b$ is divided by $1000$.}

\sol Casework on day caught and then use complementary PIE.

\subsection{Perspectives}
\prob{1}{PuMAC 2019}{How many ways can you arrange 3 Alice’s, 1 Bob, 3 Chad’s, and 1 David in a line if the Alice’s
are all indistinguishable, the Chad’s are all indistinguishable, and Bob and David want to be
adjacent to each other? (In other words, how many ways can you arrange 3 A’s, 1 B, 3 C’s,
and 1 D in a row where the B and D are adjacent?)}

\prob{2}{MA$\theta$ 2016}{The product of any two of the elements of the set $\{30, 54, N\}$ is divisible by the third. Find
the number of possible values of N.}

\sol Consider the primes $2,3,5$ separately and get independent inequalities.

\prob{3}{BmMT 2014}{If you roll three regular six-sided dice, what is the probability that the three numbers showing
will form an arithmetic sequence? (The order of the dice does matter, but we count both (1,
3, 2) and (1, 2, 3) as arithmetic sequences.)}

\prob{4}{PuMAC 2019}{Keith has 10 coins labeled 1 through 10, where the ith coin has weight $2^i$. The coins are all
fair, so the probability of flipping heads on any of the coins is $\frac{1}{2}$. After flipping all of the
coins, Keith takes all of the coins which land heads and measures their total weight, $W$. If the
probability that $137 \leq W \leq 1061$ is $m/n$ for coprime positive integers $m, n$, determine $m + n$}

\sol This bijects to even binary numbers between $0$ and $2046$. There $\frac{1060-138}{2}+1=462$ even numbers in the range $[137,1061]$. Then, $\frac{462}{1024}=\frac{231}{512}\implies \boxed{743}$.

\prob{4}{PHS HMMT TST 2016}{Compute the number of ordered triples of sets $(A_{1},A_{2},A_{3})$ that satisfy the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup A_{3} = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$
\item $A_{1}\cap A_{2}\cap A_{3} = \emptyset$
\end{enumerate}

\sol Consider each element separately and see where it can go in the Venn Diagram. It can go in $8-2=6$ sections as it can't be in all three or not in any. So, $\boxed{6^6}$.

\prob{5} {HMMT Feburary 2014}{We have a calculator with two buttons that displays an integer x. Pressing the first button replaces
$x$ by $\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor$ , and pressing the second button replaces $x$ by $4x + 1$. Initially, the calculator displays 0.
How many integers less than or equal to 2014 can be achieved through a sequence of arbitrary button
presses? (It is permitted for the number displayed to exceed 2014 during the sequence. Here, byc
denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to the real number y.)}

\sol Any number with $1$ digits separated by one or more $0$'s  is valid. Notice that for $2015$ through $2047$, the first two digits are $11$ so they are not valid. Casework on number of digits now.
}

\subsubsection{Expected Value}

\prob{5}{SLKK AIME 2020}{
Woulard forms a 8 letter word by picking each letter from the set $\{w, o, u\}$
with equal probability. The score of a word is the nonnegative difference between the
number of distinct occurrences of the three-letter word “uwu” and the number of distinct
occurrences of the three-letter word “owo”. For example, the string “owowouwu” has a
score of 2 - 1 = 1. If the expected score of Woulard’s string can be expressed as $\frac{a}{b}$ for
relatively prime positive integers a and b, find the remainder when $a+b$ is divided by $1000$.}

\sol Let the $value$ of the string be the total number of uwu and owo's. Note that the value only differs from the score when there are both uwu and owo's. We can easily compute the value using Linearity of Expectation and do casework on when it differs.

\prob{6}{PuMAC 2019}{. Marko lives on the origin of the Cartesian plane. Every second, Marko moves 1 unit up with
probability 2/9, 1 unit right with probability 2/9, 1 unit up and 1 unit right with probability
4/9, and he doesn’t move with probability 1/9. After 2019 seconds, Marko ends up on the
point (A, B). What is the expected value of A · B?}

\sol 

\prob{6}{PuMAC 2019}{Kelvin and Quinn are collecting trading cards; there are 6 distinct cards that could appear
in a pack. Each pack contains exactly one card, and each card is equally likely. Kelvin buys
packs until he has at least one copy of every card, then he stops buying packs. If Quinn is
missing exactly one card, the probability that Kelvin has at least two copies of the card Quinn
is missing is expressible as $m/n$ for coprime positive integers $m, n$. Determine $m + n$.}

\sol Complementary counting, find probability that Kelvin has exactly one copy of the card Quinn is missing. 
\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\prob{1}{Mandelbrot Nationals Sample Test}{Michael Jordan's probability of hitting any basketball shot is three times greater than mine, which never exceeds a third. To beat him in a game, I need to hit a shot myself and have Jordan miss the same shot. If I pick my shot optimally, what is the maximum probability of winning which I can attain?}

\sol What's the max of $p(1-3p)$? 

\prob{3}{PHS ARML TST 2017}{Consider a group of eleven high school students. To create a middle school math contest, they must
pick a four-person committee to write problems and a four-person committee to proofread. Every
student can be on neither committee, one committee, or both committees, except for one student who
does not want to be on both. How many combinations of committees are possible?}

\sol Complementary counting, find how many committees have that student on both and how many committees without that restriction

\prob{3}{Mandelbrot Regionals 2009}{Mr. Strump has formed three person groups in his math class for working on projects. Every student is in exactly two groups, and any two groups have at most one person in common. In fact, if two groups are chosen at random then the probability that they have exactly one person in common is one-third. How many students are there in Mr. Strump’s class?}

\subsection{Divisors}
\prob{1}{MA$\theta$ 2018}{How many distinct prime numbers are in the first 50 rows of Pascal’s Triangle?}

\sol If $k\neq 1,n-1$ for $\binom{n}{k}$, then $\binom{n}{k}$ is composite by its explicit formula. So, $\binom{n}{1}=n$, how many of those are prime for $1\leq n\leq 50$? 

\prob{2}{AHSME 1984}{ How many triples $(a,b,c)$ of positive integers satisify the simultaneous equations:
$$ab+bc=44$$
$$ac+bc=23$$}

\prob{2}{PHS ARML TST 2017}{Compute the greatest prime factor of 
$$3^8+2\cdot 2^4\cdot 4^4+2^{16}$$}

\sol Let $3^4=x$ and $4^4=y$. Then, this is just $x^2+2xy+y^2=(x+y)^2$.

\prob{2}{HMMT November 2014}{Compute the greatest common divisor of $4^8 - 1$ and $8^{12} - 1$}

\prob{3}{MA$\theta$ 2018}{The number $1 \cdot 1! + 2 \cdot 2! + 3 \cdot 3! +\cdots + 100 \cdot 100!$ ends with a string of 9s. How many
consecutive 9s are at the end of the number?}

\sol $n\cdot n! = (n+1)!-n!$, then telescope to get $101!-1!$. How many $0$'s does $101!$ have?

\prob{5}{BMT 2015}{There exists a unique pair of positive integers k, n such that k is divisible by 6, and $\sum_{i=1}^{k} i^2 = n^2$.
Find $(k, n)$.}

\sol You get $k\cdot (6k+1)\cdot (12k+1)=n^2$. All of these are pairwise coprime so each are squares. Trying out the first couple of squares for $k$, we get $k=4$ is a solution. Having both $b^2=6a^2+1$ and $c^2=12a^2+1$ be squares is not possible for larger $a$.
 
\subsection{Modulo}

\prob{1}{MA$\theta$ 2018}{The number $4^{14}-1$ is divisible by $29$ but $2^{14}-1$ is not. What is the remainder when $2^{14}-1$ is divided by $29$?}

\sol $4^{14}-1=(2^{14}-1)(2^{14}+1)=0\pmod{29}$. Since $2^{14}-1\neq 0 \pmod{29}$, $2^{14}+1=0\pmod{29}\implies 2^{14}-1=27\pmod{29}$

\prob{3}{CNCM PoTD}{Find the number of positive integer $x$ less than $100$ such that 
$$3^x+5^x+7^x+11^x+13^x+17^x+19^x$$ is prime.}

\sol Considering $\pmod{3}$, we get $3(1)^x+3(-1)^x=0\pmod{3}$ which is impossible as the expression is clearly $>3$. So, $\boxed{0}$.

\prob{4}{SLLKK AIME 2020}{Smush is a huge Kobe Bryant fan. Smush randomly draws n jerseys
from his infinite collection of Kobe jerseys, each being either the recent \#24 jersey or the
throwback \#8 jersey with equal probability. Let $p(n)$ be the probability that Smush can
divide the $n$ jerseys into two piles such that the sum of all jersey numbers in each pile is
the same. If}

\prob{5}{BMT 2019}{Compute the remainder when the product of all positive integers less than and relatively prime
to 2019 is divided by 2019.}

\prob{5}{PHS HMMT TST 2020}{Find the largest integer $0 < n < 100$ such that $n^2 + 2n$ divides $4(n-1)! + n + 4$.}

\sol For $n$ is even, $n^2+2n=(n)(n+2)=4(\frac{n}{2})(\frac{n+2}{2})$. $4(n-1)!=0\pmod{4(\frac{n}{2})(\frac{n+2}}{2})$, then we get $n+4=0\pmod{n^2+2n}$ which is impossible. For $n$ is odd, $n^2+2n=(n)(n+2)$ and $\gcd(n,n+2)=1$. If either of $n, n+2$ are composite, WLOG $n=0\pmod{p}$ for some prime $p<n$, then $(n-1)!=0\pmod{p}\implies n+4=0\pmod{p}\implies 4 =0\pmod{p}$ contradiction. Similar for $n+2$. Then, we have that $n,n+2$ must be both primes. We show that this works. We have $4(n-1)!+n+4\pmod{n}=-4+4=0\pmod{n}$ by Wilsons'. Also, $4(n-1)!+n+4\pmod{n+2}=2+4\frac{-1}{(n+1)(n)}\pmod{n+2}=2+4\frac{-1}{2}\pmod{n+2}=2-2=0\pmod{n+2}$. Since $\gcd(n,n+2)=1$, we're done.

The largest twin primes in the range are $\boxed{71},73$.

\prob{7}{HMMT November 2014}{Suppose that $m$ and $n$ are integers with $1 \leq m \leq 49$ and $n \ge 0$ such that $m$ divides $n^{n+1} + 1$. What is the number of possible values of $m$?}

the stored value by 2 and add 1 or he may multiply the stored value by 4 and add 3. The first player
to make the stored value exceed 2100 wins. The stored value starts at 1 and Mark goes first. Assuming
both players play optimally, what is the maximum number of times that William can make a move?
(By optimal play, we mean that on any turn the player selects the move which leads to the best possible
outcome given that the opponent is also playing optimally. If both moves lead to the same outcome,

We can see that $\frac{-1 + \sqrt{8057}}{2}>\sqrt{2015}$ and that $\frac{-1-\sqrt{8057}}{2} < -\sqrt{2015}$. Also, $\frac{1-\sqrt{8061}}{2} > - \sqrt{2015}$ and $\frac{1+\sqrt{8061}}{2} > \sqrt{2015}$. So, we have that our two solutions are $\frac{-1-\sqrt{8057}}{2}$ and $\frac{1+\sqrt{8061}}{2}$. \\
\\
Then, $\frac{1}{S}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{8061}-\sqrt{8057}}=\frac{\sqrt{8061}+\sqrt{8057}}{2}$. So, $89 < \frac{1}{S} < 90$ so our answer is $\boxed{89}$

\sol Analyzing, Carl must be lying since if he was telling the truth, everyone else are lying which means Alice can't have the coin but the person who has the coin isn't male which is a contradiction. Also note that all of them can't be lying by similar reasoning. So, either two, three, or four are telling the truth. Four telling the truth is impossible as Carl's statement is false. Three telling the truth means everyone but Carl is telling the truth which is impossible as Alice and Dave's statements conflict. So, two must be telling the truth. Dave's and Alice's statements are true if and only if the other is false.
